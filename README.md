# Pokemon Horoscope
Have you ever realized that people sometimes justify their attitudes, behaviour and reactions to 
different life situations just because of what their horoscope (star sign) describes their personality based on 
their date of birth? 
\
\
With this Pokemon Horoscope, a user inputs their name and the site randomly assigns them a pokemon name, 
a super power and a super move, from the Pokemon API. There are infinite combinations of the different 
pokemons, abilities and moves.
